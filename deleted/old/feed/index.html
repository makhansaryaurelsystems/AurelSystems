<p>A good way to start your process study with CADSIM Plus is to do a steady-state heat and material balance. Soon, you will be ready to add tanks and level control to control makeup in the same manner as the real plant. At this point, the balance is still largely steady-state and can be used for a variety of process investigations.</p>



<p>You will likely use the dynamic simulation capabilities of CADSIM Plus to solve specific dynamic problems that you identify, or to simulate batch or scheduled operations. CADSIM Plus is ideal for allowing you to evolve from a steady-state balance to a dynamic simulation, while allowing zones of your simulation to grow in detail to a higher fidelity. It is important to note that areas of higher fidelity can be added to a CADSIM Plus balance as needed. You will not have to add more detail than you require to satisfy your specific questions.</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus supports up to 9 different process definitions or sets of stream components on a single simulation (plus one logic layer set). This allows you to add steam (for example) where you require steam, and leave it out where it is not needed.</p>



<p>One common example where a simulation might grow to have zones of higher fidelity in a specific area, is pressure-flow networks. You may wish to study the control or line and pump sizing for a specific line or branches of piping. For this piping, you can add pumps with pump curves, valves with characteristic curves, (such as equal percentage or fast opening), piping configuration (such as diameter, elevation, and total equivalent length) and controllers that open or close their valves. Flows are then calculated through head and pressure drop calculations.</p>



<p>An important aspect of CADSIM Plus&#8217;s ability to create zones of fidelity, is that this allows you to add pressure flow network detail only in the network that you are trying to solve. You do not have to add this level of detail to the rest of the flowsheet, nor do you have to add it to other drawings/models that you may be running as part of a plant-wide dynamic simulation. This unique feature of CADSIM Plus can save you an enormous amount of time and money by avoiding unnecessarily detailed modeling where it is not needed.</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus allows your simulation to evolve to solve your problems with minimal effort from you. Running the simulation is highly interactive. You can even select one of several pre-configured modes of operation or control with the single push of a button!</p>

<p>CADSIM Plus&#8217;s SmartCalc™ accelerates both process simulation calculation and results display. SmartCalc manages flowsheet calculations to speed up runtime performance. Calculation times can be an order of magnitude faster than what is possible with any other process simulator.</p>



<p>SmartCalc is a combination of more than 10 proprietary technologies that were developed for CADSIM Plus by Aurel Systems. These new technologies work together to boost runtime performance of simulation calculations and results display. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>Lengthy calculations are only performed if they are required &#8211; and then, only if the executive program has detected changes to their input values</li><li>Careful coding of graphical routines allows&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aurelsystems.com/living-drawings/">Living Drawings</a>&nbsp;with dozens, or even hundreds of animations, to perform exceptionally fast</li><li>Live displays of hundreds, or even thousands of separate simulation results can be displayed more than 10 times faster using SmartCalc, than with conventional graphic technologies</li></ul>



<p>So how fast is CADSIM Plus? CADSIM Plus can run a real mill area flowsheet featuring dozens of stream components running through hundreds of equipment units on an entry-level PC computer at more than&nbsp;<strong>17,000 times faster</strong>&nbsp;than real time. That would allow you to observe the next&nbsp;<strong>12.5 days</strong>&nbsp;of scheduled operation in approximately&nbsp;<strong>1 minute</strong>&nbsp;of real time.</p>

<p>A unique&nbsp;Open Simulation Systems Architecture™ (OSSA™) was developed by Aurel to make CADSIM Plus a generic process simulation platform. CADSIM Plus can host different simulator &#8220;personalities&#8221; for various industry sectors. It is extensible so that anyone with C++ programming skills can include their own custom process modules. And source code is available for purchase for most process modules.</p>



<p>All process-specific information, including units of process equipment, streams, physical properties, specialized controllers, and special purpose modules such as logic and signal units are external to the CADSIM Plus program, and are loaded at runtime. All modules conform to our OSSA communications standard, which defines how each module must describe itself and its requirements to the CADSIM Plus program.</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus surveys all of the modules in the libraries that are present, and then assesses your process flowsheet to choose a &#8216;best fit&#8217; module for each piece of equipment, using a keyword structure and artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>



<p>Object-oriented design is an important part of the CADSIM Plus architecture. Unit module objects are joined by streams, physical properties and specifications which are also objects. This is unique to CADSIM Plus. Coded objects are used for stream calculations. These objects allow complex relationships, including conditional calculations and equations that are not possible in other simulators &#8211; which pass data structures or arrays of numbers as streams. And, because code is encapsulated in one place, it does not have to be repeated in every unit module. This increases functionality and greatly improves performance and computer resource management.</p>



<p>Another big advantage of object-oriented design is that unit modules do not have to know every detail about the stream calculations. This means that adding a new stream variable does not require all existing unit modules to be recoded. What this means to you is that it is easier and faster to develop new modules for CADSIM Plus.</p>



<p>An open system standard ensures that you have access to a rich variety of module options for your process models. From commercially available libraries, to custom module development, to the ability to do your own in-house using ANSI standard C/C++ coding &#8211; you will always have the ability to model a unique piece of equipment &#8211; now, or in the future.</p>

<p>Living Drawings™ technology allows you to create a simulation model by drawing a process flowsheet. Anything that you can draw can be interpreted into a process simulation model by CADSIM Plus.</p>



<h3 class="align-left">CAD mode:</h3>



<p>CADSIM Plus includes a CAD interface which allows you to draw a process flowsheet. An expert system has the process &#8220;smarts&#8221; to interpret the drawing you create, into a simulation. Drawings look exactly as you wish to present them. We call this &#8216;free-format&#8217; drawing. CADSIM Plus also includes a large library of drawing parts, but unlike icon-based simulators, anything that you have drawn can easily be made into a part for future use. CADSIM Plus supports any level of drawing complexity from a simple block diagram to a detailed engineering drawing. CAD capabilities are especially suitable for detailed P&amp;ID, P&amp;C or logic-type drawings.</p>



<h3 class="align-left">Runtime mode:</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image float-right"><a href="https://aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/runtime2.gif" rel="lightbox[506]"><img src="https://www.aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/runtime2-300x225.gif" alt="Shortcut PID Controller" class="wp-image-1281" srcset="https://www.aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/runtime2-300x225.gif 300w, https://www.aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/runtime2-768x576.gif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure>



<p>CADSIM Plus includes an ‘electronic flowsheet&#8217; runtime mode interface. The original CADSIM drawing that you created is automatically transformed into an interactive and animated simulation tool. CADSIM Plus Living Drawings™ allow you to change conditions while the simulated process is running. Simulation results (numbers and text) can be formatted in any way at any location on the drawing. Results are automatically updated with each simulation iteration. Strip charts are used to log dynamic response. A single click on any drawing object gives you access to runtime functions such as controller settings and set-points. Any graphical object can be animated to show tank levels, pump on/off conditions, valves open/closed, motor status, species or temperature change with changing colors, etc.</p>



<p>Many of the runtime features are created for you automatically. The stream specification icons that you placed on the drawing to describe the process, automatically become default PID controllers, with intelligent default settings that are chosen to fit the situation. The entire CAD drawing becomes a point-and-click interface for accessing simulation data.</p>



<p>With CADSIM Plus, you get the best of both worlds &#8211; full CAD drawings for hard copy and sophisticated runtime simulation interactivity. Don&#8217;t waste time repeating work in different ways with different software for different purposes &#8212; do it all with CADSIM Plus!</p>

<p>In order to understand the concept of stream-based specifications, it is necessary to understand what is meant by the following terms:</p>



<ul><li><em>Specifications</em>&nbsp;are objects with which you input parameters into CADSIM Plus unit modules so that the module can perform the calculations that you require</li><li>Unit modules are individual pieces of equipment or controls that populate your simulation model. These unit modules usually have real-world counterparts, such as tanks, heaters, separators, and pumps</li><li><em>Streams</em>&nbsp;are pipes that connect unit modules</li><li><em>Stream-based specifications</em>&nbsp;allow unit modules to ask the streams to provide specification values</li></ul>



<p>Some simulators use unit-based dialog boxes which only allow you to pick from a list of descriptions and numerical entry fields. While this method is simple, it drastically restricts the type of stream information that can be asked for by the units. It also restricts each unit to a finite number of named streams, because the dialog boxes are already built to give a predefined list to you. With CADSIM Plus, stream-based specifications allow you unlimited choices in variables which you can specify. Having stream-based specifications in CADSIM Plus allows you to add any number of outlet streams to units such as Separators, and still have flexible specification options.</p>



<p>Although CADSIM Plus allows simple numeric specifications, these are just one of a variety of options that are available to you. Our FlexSpec™ technology allows you nearly unlimited flexibility in specifying your process problem the way that you want to. Just one example of specification flexibility is:</p>



<ul><li>An outlet temperature could be set to a value, or to 5 degrees above an inlet temperature, or to be the same as the stream&#8217;s boiling point (with rise), or to 20 degrees of superheat.</li></ul>



<p>All specification objects give you the ability to use equations to specify your model. You can equate one value to another, ratio or calculate values for any unit module or stream parameter. If you need even more complexity, you can use a series of equations or cascading equations. Values can be filtered, transformed, or passed through PID or Fuzzy Logic controllers. Different values can even be selected for differing process conditions.</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus specifications appear graphically on your flowsheet model&nbsp;so that you can survey and adjust these relationships quickly and easily. There are no mystery values hidden away.</p>



<p>The specification flexibility of CADSIM Plus is often the feature that users mention first when they compare our simulator to others that they have used in the past. If you want to specify your process model in ways that make sense to you, and yield results that are easily compared with your process, then CADSIM Plus is your best choice.</p>

<p>How long does it take to learn to use CADSIM Plus?</p>



</a>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapseExample1">
        <div class="card card-body">



<p>By doing the CADSIM Plus Tutorial exercises, you can complete your first simple flowsheet balance in just a few hours. In a few days of practice, you can be fairly proficient at creating and developing more complex flowsheets. Advanced dynamic modelling &nbsp;may take significantly longer to master, but we are here to help!</p>



<p>Aurel Systems offers several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aurelsystems.com/training/">training options</a>&nbsp;that include on-site training courses for small groups and one-on-one web-based training (by the hour) to assist you in getting up to speed, while working on a project of your choice.</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus has thousands of sophisticated features. As you take on additional challenges (such as advanced process control, dynamic simulation, optimization, logic and online linking to other programs) you will continue to learn new techniques and master new tools. Aurel&#8217;s just-in-time and just-enough training can assist you when you are ready to tackle a new modeling challenge.</p>

</a>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapse3">
    <div class="card card-body">



<p>There is no trial version of CADSIM Plus available at this time. However, there are a couple of ways that you can evaluate CADSIM Plus at little or no cost to you:</p>



<ul><li><a href="mailto:mail@aurelsystems.com?subject=*Trial%20version%20of%20CADSIM%20Plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact Aurel</a>&nbsp;to arrange a live demonstration of CADSIM Plus via the web. Demonstrations are customized to cover your specific process simulation and modelling questions.</li><li>Arrange a short-term (3 month) lease. We will refund part of your short-term lease cost (before taxes) against the purchase price if you decide to buy a CADSIM Plus license immediately following or during your lease period.</li></ul>

<p>What if CADSIM Plus does not meet&nbsp;our needs?</p>



</a>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapse4">
    <div class="card card-body">



<p>Aurel and its representatives make every effort to ensure that your pre-sales questions are answered, and that you choose the CADSIM Plus tools that are right for you. However, if you are not completely satisfied with your CADSIM Plus purchase, simply return the software and copy protection device to Aurel within 30 days of receipt and we will cancel your Net 30 invoice.&nbsp;<strong>Please note that there is no money-back guarantee on leases.</strong></p>

<p>What kinds of product support are available?</p>



</a>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapse5">
    <div class="card card-body">



<p>One year of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aurelsystems.com/maintenance-support/">maintenance and support</a>&nbsp;is included with a CADSIM Plus&nbsp;<strong>license purchase</strong>. You can purchase a renewal of your CADSIM Plus support and maintenance plan after the first year. CADSIM Plus&nbsp;<strong>leases</strong>&nbsp;include support and maintenance for the duration of the lease.</p>



<ul><li>Support includes telephone and e-mail support for technical questions pertaining to the installation and operation of the CADSIM Plus software. Note that chemical engineering support is not included, but is available on an hourly basis at extra cost.</li><li>Maintenance includes the regular posting of program&nbsp;<strong>updates</strong>&nbsp;on Aurel&#8217;s update server, which are available via&nbsp;the built-in program updater. Updates are minor releases which address reported issues in the current version of the software.</li><li>Maintenance also includes any program&nbsp;<strong>upgrades</strong>&nbsp;that may be released by Aurel during the support period. Upgrades are major version releases that include program enhancements and improvements.</li></ul>



<p>Aurel endeavors to answer all e-mail support questions within 24 hours. E-mail support is generally preferred, because it is helpful for us to receive a sample model and detailed description from the client, so that we can quickly and accurately assess the user&#8217;s modeling problem.</p>



<p>In some cases, a support request may result in the issue of a program update. Program updates may be made available to the client as soon as 24 hours following problem diagnosis.</p>

<p>Are there different versions of CADSIM Plus?</p>



</a>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapse6">
    <div class="card card-body">



<p>Yes. There are a number of different versions and options for CADSIM Plus. These include:</p>



<ul><li>Full version &#8211; can be used to create and run simulation models</li><li>Runtime version &#8211; allows you to run the simulation, but not to change the simulation model</li><li>Optional Module Libraries &#8211; these include Fiber, Power, Hydrocarbon Processing and Hydrocarbon Physical Properties (1200 components), Mineral (zinc processing)</li></ul>



<p>There is no specific network-enabled version of CADSIM Plus. There is a network copy protection system for CADSIM Plus that allows a multi-user key to be installed on a server. For best performance, the software is installed locally on the client workstation.</p>

     <a class="btn btn-primary faq-toggle-button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#multiCollapse7" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="multiCollapse7">



<p>Does CADSIM Plus use a copy protection device?</p>



</a>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapse7">
    <div class="card card-body">



<p>Yes, a hardware key is required to run CADSIM Plus. We use the Sentinel/HASP hardware key, which has the following advantages: CADSIM Plus software does not require activation and does not brand itself to a specific computer. There is no limit to the number of times that your copy of CADSIM Plus can be installed. USB keys can be used either on a network server (shared) or directly on a workstation</p>



<p>Keys can be installed on a network server or peer computer, along with a small HASP License Manager program. On a network, a&nbsp;key can provide copy protection for a pre-programmed number of simultaneous users, who have access from anywhere on your network.</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus software is installed locally on each CADSIM Plus workstation. Aurel does not restrict the number of installations of CADSIM Plus and does not require activation. The number of simultaneous users is governed by the shared&nbsp;key. Shared&nbsp;keys can be set up so that they can be accessed via a WAN.</p>

<p>What are the system requirements for running CADSIM Plus?</p>



</a>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapse9">
    <div class="card card-body">



<p>You can run CADSIM Plus on any typical business-class Windows workstation. Typical recommended memory would be 2Gig of RAM (or more) for Windows Vista, Win 7 Win 8x or Win 10. Storage requirements are 100MB for program files and 65MB for data files.</p>



<p>There is a strong advantage to choosing one or more high-resolution monitors (suitable for CAD) or a notebook computer with a 17&#8243; high-resolution screen. For example, a 24 inch, 1920 x 1200 pixel, UXGA monitor would be ideal. At this time, CADSIM Plus does not require any type of database server support.</p>

<p>&#8230;and what communication protocols does CADSIM Plus support?</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus supports&nbsp;<strong>DDE</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>COM</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>OPC</strong>&nbsp;communication protocols. Currently, CADSIM Plus can act as an OPC DA client. It can pull data from other sources (such as Excel or a mill historian) and put simulation data back. This is very useful when combined with our Dynamic Data Reconciliation (DDR) and Optimization features to create online applications for various purposes that can run in parallel to a &#8216;live&#8217; process.</p>

<p>There are three main steps to creating a basic chemical process simulation in CADSIM Plus:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Create</strong>&nbsp;a process sketch or drawing in Drawing Mode.</li><li><strong>Define</strong>&nbsp;process chemistry, add formats to display results, answer questions to specify flows, reactions and events in the model using Specification Mode.</li><li><strong>Run</strong>&nbsp;and interact with your model and observe the results in Run Mode.</li></ol>



<p>CADSIM Plus is a process engineering tool. It does not, however, do process engineering for you. It is a powerful tool which assists process engineers in doing their work.</p>



<h3>Draw a Process Flowsheet</h3>



<p>CADSIM Plus contains a full CAD drawing mode that you use to draw your process flowsheet model. You can begin by adding a border to your drawing to set the paper size. You can quickly insert drawing parts by choosing from the hundred&#8217;s of prepared parts that are included with CADSIM Plus, or make your own by sketching process shapes to represent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aurelsystems.com/module-libraries/">units of equipment</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image float-right"><a href="https://aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tutor1.gif" rel="lightbox[2709]"><img src="https://www.aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tutor1.gif" alt="Step 1 - Draw" class="wp-image-576"/></a></figure>



<p>You can clone areas of the drawing and copy them into new locations. Join them by drawing lines which represent pipes. Window an area of the drawing to make a new part to add to your own parts library.</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus Drawing Mode is optimized for flowsheet drawing. Arrowheads are automatically inserted on lines, indicating direction of flow. Smart positioning of text and lines speeds up placement. Line sections are automatically removed where lines cross (but do not join) to make the drawing easier to read. Adder and Splitter units are automatically created where lines join or divide.</p>



<p>Process shapes can be drawn in any form. There are generally no restrictions on the number and positioning of streams entering or leaving general-purpose units such as Tanks. You can use shapes that are familiar to you and to your industry sector.</p>



<p>Make your sketch as simple or as complex as you desire. You can add animations and color changes that are connected to process variables, providing runtime feedback. When you have finished you sketch, move on to defining the process chemistry.</p>



<h3>Specify the Process Model</h3>



<p>Once your flowsheet is finished, CADSIM Plus enters specification mode where you will be asked to define process chemistry. You can use up to nine different Stream Definitions on up to 256 drawing layers for maximum flexibility in specifying your process simulation model. Choose a stream definition that fits your industry (food, mining, hydrocarbon, pulp and paper, etc.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image float-right"><a href="https://aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tutor2.gif" rel="lightbox[2709]"><img src="https://www.aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tutor2.gif" alt="Step2 - Specify Process Relationships" class="wp-image-583"/></a></figure>



<p>Choose from the built-in chemical componds, or define your own compounds using our built-in compound editor. Add your own derived process variables, if desired. Work in US, Imperial or Metric units of measure, or use a mixture of all three.</p>



<p>Once your process stream chemistry is defined, you may add formats to streams and equipment units to display formatted simulation results. Place these formats on lines, inside process shapes, or create tables for them. You can also export results &#8216;live&#8217; to other programs via DDE, COM or OPC links.</p>



<p>Next, CADSIM Plus will step through your model and prompt you for relationships to satisfy &#8220;degrees of freedom&#8221; for each variable at each transition point throughout the model (such as where flows divide, or combine, or where they enter or leave a piece of equipment, or where they enter or leave the model). CADSIM Plus insures that your model is not over or under specified. Choose from a variety of equation types to describe your process.</p>



<p>Our stream-based specifications offer maximum flexibility for specifying your process models. In CADSIM Plus, streams are objects that perform their own calculations. You are not limited to specifying your problem within a unit block. In CADSIM Plus it is easy, for example, to specify a flow on one stream, in order to satisfy some relationship found in a different area of the model.</p>



<p>CADSIM Plus creates valve, sensor and other icons for each specification. These icons graphically show the process variables, and make it easy to see how they relate. During runtime, some of these icons are automatically transformed into short-cut PID controllers which you can manipulate to control the simulation (you can use the built-in AutoTune wizard to tune your controllers via the Lambda tuning method at runtime.)</p>



<p>When all of the degrees of freedom are satisfied, CADSIM Plus is ready to run your model.</p>



<h3>Run the&nbsp;Simulation</h3>



<p>Now you are ready to run your process simulation model. Click on controllers and change flows, or tune controller responses using the Autotune Lambda tuning wizard. Watch as data is logged in strip charts. Tank levels will rise and fall. Pumps may switch on or off in response to changing variables and scripted events, or to a click from your mouse. Logic and Signal diagrams execute your logic events. SmartCalc™ automatically accelerates your model to iterate at thousands of times faster than &#8216;real time&#8217;!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image float-right"><a href="https://aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tutor3.gif" rel="lightbox[2709]"><img src="https://www.aurelsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tutor3.gif" alt="Step 3 - Run the Simulation" class="wp-image-587"/></a></figure>



<p>Your sketch has been transformed into a Living Drawing™. Clicking on any line, unit, or control displays dialogue boxes with current simulated results and settings that you can change. These are created for you automatically.</p>



<p>You can export data for further analysis. Insert one or more cases of data into the drawing to be plotted from within CADSIM Plus. Or, create an AutoCAD®; drawing from your CADSIM Plus drawing, or merge results using tags inserted into your existing AutoCAD drawing.</p>



<p>You can return to your drawing and add additional variables. Perhaps you need to add a pressure flow network to one branch of your model? Would you like to study the effects of an additional stage of cleaners? Add alternative configurations by using Dormant and Active layers to add, or remove, additional detail from your model. Perhaps you would like to a Special Component to your model, such as assigning dollar amounts to specific chemicals to create an economic model as part of the simulation. Perhaps you will choose to follow a quality parameter such as Kappa or freeness throughout part of the model.</p>



<p>Your finished model can also be linked via OPC to your plant&#8217;s information and control systems. It can used to perform advanced optimization, control or data reconciliation functions.</p>



<h4>CADSIM Plus offers you maximum power and flexibility in how your models look and perform. Add the degree of complexity that suits the problem you wish to solve. Scope or de-scope easily to suit a particular problem. It&#8217;s all possible with CADSIM Plus.</h4>
